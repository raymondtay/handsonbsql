# Getting Started

The following code examples are to get started with BlazingSQL.

Note: You should have a [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/) installation working in a supported GPU. For
BSQL, the requirements are that it should have _compute capability_ >= 6.0

## List of source code

The examples here are for you to get started, its not meant for _production_
use since it lacks a test harness.
